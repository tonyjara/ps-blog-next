### What's an RSS Feed?

An RSS Feed is nothing more than a long XML file that holds information. It's pretty similar to what an HTML file is. If you're not familiar with either one, you can think of it as the building blocks that make your Podcast's feed, there are blocks for each episode, and each episode then has blocks for  their audio files which includes information such as their duration and filetype.

### But why do we need it?

If you're only looking to list your podcast in one platform like Spotify, you probably don't need it, since they offer free solutions to solve this problem. However, RSS Feed's are required by some platforms like Apple Podcasts. 

So the main reason why you need an RSS Feed is to have a single source of truth for all of your Podcast's episodes.

### How can I create an RSS Feed?

Creating an hosting an RSS Feed can be a complicated subject, since it requires hosting not only your feed but all the media that comes associated with it. 

Luckily at Podcast Solutions, we make it easy and completely free up to 1GB of audio hosting ( 16.5 hours of .mp3 audio)  to host your Podcast's RSS Feed. We only charge you if you use our services such as audio to text transcription, show notes generation, keyword generations and more.
