Spotify is one of the largest podcast directories in the game. If you're trying to get any kind of traction you definitely need to have your podcast here.

- According to [BuzzSprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/podcast-statistics), 30.7% podcast fans use Spotify to listen. 
- It has [381 million monthly active users](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-10-27/spotify-reports-third-quarter-2021-earnings/) as of October 2021, which is a 19% increase compared to last year, with paid subscribers also increasing by 19 percent to 172 million. 
- With its podcasting business equally continuing to grow, not listing your show on Spotify, alongside over 3 million others, would be podcast suicide. 
- Since 2019, the number of [Spotify podcast listeners](https://podcasters.spotify.com/) has nearly doubled.
- Plus, with Spotify making big investments into exclusive podcast rights, like The Joe Rogan Experience and Michelle Obama’s podcast, and rolling out support for video podcasts, the growth is expected to continue. The sooner you jump on the bandwagon, the better.

## Requirements

The first requirement is to have a Spotify account. It does't  need to be a premium one. Just try __using that same email__ inside your podcast details on Podcast solutions to avoid issues. 

The second requirement is an RSS Feed, Spotify being a directory means that they don't host your podcast themselves, instead they rely on other platforms to do so.

__Form more context you can read on <a href="https://blog.podcastsolutions.org/why-do-podcasts-need-rss-feeds" target="_blank"> Why do we need RSS Feeds?</a>__

So if you don't have an RSS Feed already you can get started for free here at  <a href="https://podcastsolutions.org/signup" target="_blank"> Podcast Solutions</a>.

If you get your Podcast to a published status in Podcast Solutions, that means you're ready to list your Podcast.

## Listing your RSS Feed

1. Create a Spotify account if you haven't already.
2. Go to [Spotify’s podcast website](https://podcasters.spotify.com/dash/submit), and click Get Started.
3. Paste the link to your RSS Feed. You can find a copy button in your Podcast Solution's home screen.

Your podcast then will go through a verification process that could last up to 48 hours. After that you'll be able to access your podcast through their dashboard. And continue publishing through Podcast Solutions.

Keep in mind that Spotify checks your feed every 24 hours, so expect your changes to be reflected within that time.

And lastly don't forget to update your directories page inside Podcasts Solutions so it can appear on your "Listen on" links.
